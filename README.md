### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. Make sure you have all datasets stored locally in the following path: [src/servers/transfermarkt-server/data/](src/servers/transfermarkt-server/data)
    - To download the required datasets, run the [dataUpdate Jupyter Notebook](src/servers/transfermarkt-server/dataUpdate.ipynb)
    it takes about **20-30** minutes. Please read the notebook cells carefully for additional instructions.
2. Once you have all datasets, you can try the MCP Server either offline with **Inspector** or connected to your favorite **AI client** (example: Claude Desktop).
    * **Offline** with `@modelcontextprotocol/Inspector`
      1. Run the Inspector with:
          ```bash
          npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y tsx transfermarkt-server.ts
          ```
          >Usually runs at **[http://localhost:6274/](http://localhost:6274/)**

      2. Make sure the labels show this info:
          - **Transport Type:** ``STDIO``
          - **Command:** ``npx``
          - **Arguments:** ``-y tsx transfermarkt-server.ts``
          Then you can click on **`Connect`**
      3. If everything is working, select **``List Tools``** to see all available tools:

      2. Go to **``Settings>Developer>Edit Config``**
        ![alt text](/readme-assets/ClaudeEx2.png)
      3. **Open the file:** ``Claude/claude_desktop_config.json``
        ![alt text](/readme-assets/ClaudeEx3.png)
      4. **Add the following Json inside the ``mcpServers`` list**
          ```json
          "transfermarkt": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                  "-y",
                  "tsx",
                  "<PATH_TO_THE_PROJECT>/mcp-chatbot/src/servers/transfermarkt-server/transfermarkt-server.ts"
              ]
          }
          ```
      5. **Restart Claude Desktop and go again to** ``Settings>Developer``
      if everything is fine, you'll see the running tag for the transfermarkt tool.
