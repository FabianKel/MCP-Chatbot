Garnish with orange twist and cinnamon.\",\n    \"image\": \"newtons-law-apple-bourbon-cocktail\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Creole Cream Cheesecake With Caramel-Apple Topping\",\n    \"ingredients\": \"2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 16 whole crackers), 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar, 1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, melted, 2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese, 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste, 2 eggs, at room temperature, Ingredient Info: You can substitute 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1⁄4 cup buttermilk for the 1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese., 3¾ tablespoons unsalted butter, 3⁄4 cup granulated sugar, 1⁄4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, 1½ tablespoons honey, 4 cups peeled, cored, and evenly chopped Granny Smith apples (about 7), 1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 3⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt, 3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1⁄3 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1⁄3 teaspoon ground ginger, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.\\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won’t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don’t panic—it’ll still be delicious, and you’ll do better next time!\\nLet the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don’t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you’re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you’ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.\\nIn a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\",\n    \"image\": \"creole-cream-cheesecake-with-caramel-apple-topping\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Pumpkin Dutch Baby With Pumpkin Butter\",\n    \"ingredients\": \"3 large eggs, room temperature, 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin purée, divided, 1 cup milk, room temperature, 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, divided, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tsp. cinnamon, divided, ¼ tsp. allspice, ¼ tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. nutmeg, Kosher salt, ½ cup apple cider or juice, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, Powdered sugar, for serving\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Place an 8-inch ovenproof skillet or cast-iron pan in the oven and preheat to 425°.\\nOnce the oven reaches temperature, blend 3 large eggs in a blender until well combined and frothy, 1 minute. Add ¼ cup of the pumpkin purée, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp. allspice, ¼ tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. nutmeg, ½ tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition. Blend again until combined and frothy, 1 minute (scraping down the sides of the blender if necessary).\\nPull the hot pan from the oven and add the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, swirling the pan so it melts evenly across the bottom (it will bubble and brown). Once the butter is melted, immediately pour in the Dutch baby batter and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown and slightly puffed, 20 minutes.\\nWhile the Dutch baby bakes, combine ½ cup apple cider, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, the remaining ½ tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the rest of the can of pumpkin purée (about 1 ¼ cups) in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides of the pot with a spatula, until dark and thickened with no raw pumpkin flavor remaining, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice the Dutch baby (it will start to sink as soon as you take it out of the oven) and serve with the pumpkin butter and powdered sugar.\",\n    \"image\": \"pumpkin-dutch-baby-recipe\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Grilled Pork Shoulder With Butter Vinegar Sauce\",\n    \"ingredients\": \"1 Tbsp. fennel seeds, 2 Tbsp. dried oregano, 2–2½-lb. boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), Grapeseed or other neutral oil (for pork), 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more, 3 chiles de árbol, torn in half, seeds removed if desired, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp. sugar, Special Equipment: A spice mill or mortar and pestle\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Toast fennel seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until golden brown and starting to pop, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool; coarsely grind. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in oregano. Place pork on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and rub with oil. Season all over with 1 Tbsp. salt, then rub with spice mixture, packing it on. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours or chill, uncovered, up to 2 days.\\nBring chiles, vinegar, butter, and sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and sauce is reduced by about a third, about 5 minutes. Season with salt; cover and keep warm over low heat until ready to use.\\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Drizzle pork all over with oil, then grill, turning every 5 minutes or so, until extremely, gorgeously browned and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120°F, 35–45 minutes. Continue to grill, brushing with sauce and turning not quite every minute (you’re going to see flare-ups, but don’t worry), until pork is glazed and shiny and temperature on thermometer has risen to 130°F, 5–10 minutes more. Transfer pork to a platter and let rest 30 minutes; reserve remaining sauce.\\nTransfer pork to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices on platter into reserved sauce. Return sauce to a simmer. Slice pork against the grain ¼\\\" thick. Arrange on platter, spoon some sauce over, and season with salt. Serve remaining sauce alongside.\\nIf using a charcoal grill, a bed of medium-hot coals will gradually lose heat. Get a chimney started when the meat first hits the grill. About halfway through, throw some new glowing coals on the pile to keep things going.\",\n    \"image\": \"grilled-pork-shoulder-with-butter-vinegar-sauce\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Fruit Galette\",\n    \"ingredients\": \"1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes, 3 to 5 tablespoons ice water, 3 cups sliced fruit (plums, peaches, apples) and/or fresh or frozen berries, 4 tablespoons sugar, plus more for dusting, Pinch salt, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt, then add the cold butter and toss to combine. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\\nPreheat the oven to 375°F.\\nUsing the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.\\nPlace the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously—over the crust and the fruit, too—with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.\\nServe warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.\",\n    \"image\": \"fruit-galette\"\n  }\n]"
